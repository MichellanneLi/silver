##Instructions for Prototypes

Thank you for helping us with developing or refining prototypes for Silver, the successor to WCAG.

*  Please review the [Suggestions from the Design Sprint](https://www.w3.org/community/silver/2018/04/23/suggestions-of-silver-design-sprint/) for an overall idea of the directions Silver is planning to take.

*  Review the [Design Sprint Report](https://www.w3.org/community/silver/draft-final-report-of-silver/) for more detail on what was discussed at the Design Sprint and for more ideas.

*  If this is a new prototype, create a new branch with the name of: prototype-[short-name-of prototype] 

*  CSS class names should follow [smacss best practices](https://smacss.com/).

*  Moving forward, I recommend that we select a prototyping framework - such as Pattern Lab or Foundation - based on whichever CMS platform we are using.

*  I also suggest that we build a living style guide to document our work and to help faciliate collaboration.
