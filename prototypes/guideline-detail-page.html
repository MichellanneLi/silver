            <h2>Conformance</h2>
            <p>Conformance information goes here. For reference, these are our goals for conformance:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Design a conformance structure and style guides that shift emphasis from “testability” to “measureability” so that guidance can be included that is not conducive to a pass/fail test.  Pass/ fail tests can be included, but they are not the only way to measure conformance.</li>
              <li>Develop scorecard or rubric measures for testing task accomplishment, instead of technical page conformance.</li>
              <li>Develop a point and ranking system that will allow more nuanced measurement of the content or product: e.g. a bronze, silver, gold, platinum rating where the bronze rating represents the minimal conformance (roughly equivalent to meeting WCAG 2 AA), and increasing ranks include inclusive design principles, task-based assessment, and usability testing.</li>
              <li>Include a definition and concept for “substantially meets” so people are not excessively penalized for bugs that may not have a large impact on the experience of people with disabilities.</li>
              <li>Remove “accessibility supported” as an author responsibility and provide guidance to authoring tools, browsers and assistive technology developers of the expected behaviors of their products.</li>
              <li>Develop a more flexible method of claiming conformance that is better suited to accommodate dynamic or more regularly updated content.</li>
            </ul>
